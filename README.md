# Website ever.co

The child theme that powers the "Ever-Co" website:
- https://test.ever.co

### Theme

The [ever.co theme](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-universe-websites/tree/master/themes/child/ever.co) is a child theme of the [Ever Parent Theme] (https://github.com/ever-co/ever-universe-websites/tree/master/themes/parent/ever).

The two main files in the Ever-co theme are functions.php and style.css (for more information, check the [official WordPress theme documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)). The theme supports the following custom post types: 
* business vertical
* company types
* jobs 
* projects 
* testimonials
* team members
  
It uses shortcodes to display the custom post types on many pages. The theme ships with a lightweight vanilla js open-source slider called [Tiny JS](https://github.com/gfwilliams/tiny-js). The theme also supports the option to upload logo and to customize the primary menu from the WordPress dashboard.

### Plugins

The Ever-co theme is compatible with the following plugins:

* Contact Form 7 - The most popular and acknowledged free plugin for creating contact forms. To edit an existing contact form on the website, go to `dashboard->contact->contact forms`
  and click on the form you want to edit. It is fairly easy to use, however, if you need further assistance, they provide an awesome [documentation](https://contactform7.com/docs/) that you can always refer to.

* Counter Number Showcase - Very nice plugin that animates the statistics tab on the home page. You can edit the options from `dashboard->counter numbers-> all counters`. Very intuitive and easy to use.

* Loco translate - It helps creating and maintaining .po and .mo translation files directly from the browser. You can use this plugin to translate plugins, themes or custom strings via the WordPress dashboard. To translate a plugin, e.g. simple job board, go to `dashboard -> loco translate -> plugins -> simple job board plugin`. Click on the desired translation (edit) and start translating! As simple as that.

* Polylang - the plugin that makes it possible to have pages on different languages. To set this plugin up, you need to assign a language to each page and then add translations to it. You basically have to create different page for each language and Polylang takes care for the rest. Check their extensive [docs](https://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/) for further guidance.

* Simple Job Board - This plugin creates custom post types Jobs and lets the admin post a new job. It is very easy to use, you just create a new Job from the admin, as if you are creating a page or a post.

* WP-Optimize - Clean, Compress, Cache - This is my favourite lightweight plugin. It empowers the user to clean up the database from unnecessary rows, expired transient options, etc., without having to write manual SQL queries. Safe, efficient and fast. With this plugin, you can also compress images that have already been uploaded to the WordPress `uploads` folder.

* Multiple Post Thumbnails - Adds the ability to add multiple post thumbnails to a post type.

* SG Optimize - Links WordPress with all the performance optimizations provided by SiteGround Hosting, e.g static resource minifications, defer render-blocking js, etc.

* Duplicate Post - Clones posts, pages or any other post type to make content entry much faster and easier.
